\section{Introduction}

The field of simulations covers a wide range of applications.
Simulations can be used to analyze the complex behavior of systems. \note{Systems are ...}

This report focuses on discrete-event simulation for card games. Board games are an interesting field for simulations because they consist of a clear set of rules and discrete-events. To achieve the right balance of fun, time, or easiness of the game, parameters must be chosen carefully. For example the number of cards at the beginning of the number of jokers in the game. Using simulations makes it simple to collect quantitative data about little details that can have a huge impact on the game.
