	This report introduces discrete-event simulations and classifies the purpose of discrete-event simulation based on its characteristics.
		Discrete-Event Simulation is a simulation paradigm that is well-suited to model dynamic event-driven scenarios like card games. This report summarizes the foundations of discrete-event simulation and realizes the concepts in a simulation framework for card games. The framework is used to implement the card game \textit{Uno}. \note{and analyzed...}

% 3: more details focus on DES, why card games. 

% 3.2 why simple uno when complex uno is implemented as well (e.g. start with simple first)

%4 motivation of the question

% move V&V to Discussion


% Questions:

% Citation Style? (chigago)

% Code, Github. relevance?

% add The Game 

% Discussion vs. Evaluation. What goes where?


% TODOS:


% add pages or chapters to citations

% introduction

% clean up github

% make all graphics figures

% monte carlo to analyze monopoly, which fields are frequently visited
