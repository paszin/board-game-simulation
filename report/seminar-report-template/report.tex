	This report introduces discrete-event simulations and classifies the purpose of discrete-event simulation based on its characteristics.
		Discrete-Event Simulation is a simulation paradigm that is well-suited to model dynamic event-driven scenarios like card games. This report summarizes the foundations of discrete-event simulation and realizes the concepts in a simulation framework for card games. The framework is used to implement the card game \textit{Uno}. \note{and analyzed...}

% 3: more details focus on DES, why card games. 

% 3.2 why simple uno when complex uno is implemented as well (e.g. start with simple first)

%4 motivation of the question

% move V&V to Discussion


% Questions:

% How to cite with page number if a source occurs more than once?
% chapter

% what if a paragraph is cited from another source that i can not find?

% Citation Style? (chigago)

% Ratio between sections --> foundations biggest part

% Fidelity, Resolution, Scale (where to put it in this structure) --> foundations

% Number of references: Is there a minimum of references?

% Code, Github. relevance?

% add The Game 

% Discussion vs. Evaluation. What goes where?


% TODOS:

% change cite style

% add pages or chapters to citations

% introduction

% clean up github

% add refs and labels to sections

% make all graphics figures
